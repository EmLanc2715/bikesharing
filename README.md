# NYC CitiBike Data
Tableau

## Overview

Bikesharing data from CitiBike in New York City was used to create a presentation for investors that illustrated the potential for a similar bikesharing program to be developed in Des Moines, Iowa. A story was created with Tableau to demonstrate how a smaller city like Des Moines, could benefit from a bikesharing program. The presentation answers questions that investors would have upon starting this new business venture, including:

- What time of day are bikes being used the most?
- Who is using the bikeshare program?
- How many bikes are needed?
- What is the ratio of one time customers to subscribers?

The above graph shows the trip duration of users in more detail. The peak checkout time for users is 6 minutes.

#### Checkout Time by Gender

The above graph illustrates the difference in trip duration between genders. Males have a peak trip duration of 6 minutes, for females the average is also 6 minutes, and the average for unknowns is 11 minutes.

#### Trips by Weekday per Hour

The heatmap above illustrates the peak hours of usage by weekday. The most active hours for CitiBike users is in during weekday mornings (7-9am) and also in the later afternnon/early evenings (5-7pm). This suggests that users are utilizing CitiBikes to go to and from work. It is also notable that there is an increase of usage on the weekends. This can be explained by New Yorkers using CitiBikes to get around on weekends.

The above image reinforces the conclusion that males are the primary users of CtiBike during the week. Specifically, males that are subsribers to CitiBike.
#### Start Location for Users
![Start Locations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101427781/189397705-6818d916-d541-4060-aab2-bd5f32cb2954.png)

The image above shows the start locations for each user. These are clustered around Manhatten. The size of the circles is related to the number of trips started at these locations. Bike usage is lower in the surrounding neighborhoods.

#### End Location for Users
![End_Location](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101427781/189397720-c6771cab-46e3-42ed-b78e-2b831de4ffce.png)

The image above showing the ending location for each user is similar to the map of starting locations. This is good news for investors, the bikes are staying in the same general locations which will make maintenance easier than if the starting and ending locations were vastly different.
